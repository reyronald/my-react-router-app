# Welcome to React Router!

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> For the Prisma CLI commands to work you need an `.env` file in the root of the project that has the value for `DATABASE_URL`. You can do that manually and get the value from `.env.local`, or just run `cp .env.local .env`

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
